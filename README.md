# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
This program takes as input the speed of a car and calculates the number of demerit points the driver will receive for exceeding the speed limit. If the speed is less than 70, the program prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), the driver gets one demerit point. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
